# SAP Conversational AI Matcher (previously Recast.ai)

## Configuring opsdroid

In order to enable SAP Conversational AI skills, you must specify an `access-token` for your bot in the parsers section of the opsdroid configuration file.
You can find this `access-token` in the settings of your bot under the name: `'Request access token'`.

You can also set a `min-score` option to tell opsdroid to ignore any matches which score less than a given number between 0 and 1. The default for this is 0 which will match all messages.

```yaml

parsers:
  - name: sapcai
    access-token: 85769fjoso084jd
    min-score: 0.8
```

##

[SAP Conversational AI](https://cai.tools.sap/) is an NLP API for matching strings to [intents](https://cai.tools.sap/docs/concepts/intent). Intents are created on the SAP Conversational AI website.

## [Example 1](#example1)

```python
from opsdroid.skill import Skill
from opsdroid.matchers import match_sapcai

class MySkill(Skill):
    @match_sapcai('greetings')
    async def hello(self, message):
        """Replies to user when any 'greetings'
        intent is returned by SAP Conversational AI
        """
        await message.respond("Hello there!")
```

The above skill would be called on any intent which has a name of `'greetings'`.

## Example 2

```python
from opsdroid.skill import Skill
from opsdroid.matchers import match_sapcai

class MySkill(Skill):
    @match_sapcai('ask-joke')
    async def my_skill(self, message):
        """Returns a joke if asked by the user"""
        await message.respond('What do you call a bear with no teeth? -- A gummy bear!')
```

The above skill would be called on any intent which has a name of `'ask-joke'`.


## Creating a SAP Conversational AI bot
You need to [register](https://cai.tools.sap/signup) on SAP Conversational AI and create a bot in order to use SAP Conversational AI with opsdroid.

You can find a quick getting started with the SAP Conversational AI guide [here](https://cai.tools.sap/docs/concepts/create-builder-bot).

If you want to use SAP Conversational AI in a different language other than English, all you need to do is specify the `lang` parameter in opsdroid's configuration.

_Note: "If you do not have any expressions in this language, we will use your default bot language for processing." - [SAP Conversational AI Language page](https://cai.tools.sap/docs/concepts/language)_

## Message object additional parameters

### `message.recastai`

An http response object which has been returned by the SAP Conversational AI API. This allows you to access any information from the matched intent including other entities, intents, values, etc.


## Example Skill

```python
from opsdroid.skill import Skill
from opsdroid.matchers import match_sapcai

import json

class MySkill(Skill):
    @match_sapcai('ask-feeling')
    async def dump_response(self, message):
        print(json.dumps(message.recastai))
```

### Return Value on "How are you?"

The example skill will print the following on the message "how are you?".

```json
{
    "results":
      {
        "uuid": "cab86e23-caaf-4131-9b83-a564887203da",
