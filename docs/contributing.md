## Workflow

All contributors to the project, including the project founder [jacobtomlinson](https://github.com/jacobtomlinson), contribute using the following process:

 * Fork the main project to your own account
 * Work on your changes on a feature branch
 * Create a pull request back to the main project
 * Tests and test coverage will be checked automatically
 * A project maintainer will review and merge the pull request

## Developing

```shell
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/opsdroid/opsdroid.git
cd opsdroid

# install the project in "editable" mode
pip install -e .

# run opsdroid
python -m opsdroid
```

Running the tests

```shell
# install test runner
pip install -U tox

# run tests
tox
```


## Developing in containers

Developing in containers can be a great way to ensure that opsdroid will run in a clean python environment and that all dependencies are captured.

```shell
# build the container
docker build -t opsdroid/opsdroid:myfeature .

# run opsdroid
docker run --rm -ti -v $(pwd):/usr/src/app opsdroid/opsdroid:myfeature
```

Running the tests

```shell
# run tests
docker run --rm -ti -v $(pwd):/usr/src/app opsdroid/opsdroid:myfeature tox
```

## Documentation
More documentation is always appreciated and it's something that you can contribute to from the GitHub web interface.  This might be a great start point if you are new to Open Source and GitHub!

Things that we need help with:
 
 - More documentation. Something that you think is unclear?
 - More examples on how to use opsdroid
 - More Tutorials
 - Typos/Grammar check
 - Blog posts, articles, etc
 - Any issue marked with the [documentation tag](https://github.com/opsdroid/opsdroid/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:documentation)

## Localization
Opsdroid runs by default in English, but it can be translated to your local language. In order to achieve it, [gettext](https://docs.python.org/3/library/gettext.html) and [babel](http://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/index.html) are used.

To mark a string as translatable, just call the special `_` function:
```python
txt = 'hello {}'.format(name)  # this is NOT translatable
txt = _('hello {}').format(name)  # but now it's translatable! ðŸŽ‰
```

When some new translatable strings are added, you must extract them to a non versioned `pot` file with:
```shell
python setup.py extract_messages
```

Then, update all existing language `po` files from the extracted `pot` file with the command:
```shell
python setup.py update_catalog
```

Now, you can translate editing manually or with [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) the `po` files in `locale/<lang>/LC_MESSAGES/opsdroid.po`. Those files contain the real translations and are versioned.

After you made a change in any `po` file, in order to view the changes in opsdroid, you should compile them to `mo` binary files, the format readed by python gettext:
```shell
python setup.py compile_catalog
```

### Starting a new language
If your language is not in the `locale` folder, you can initialize it. You will need the [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) code of the language. For example, in order to start a new [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto) translation:
```shell
python setup.py init_catalog -l eo
```
Then you can translate it in `locale/eo/LC_MESSAGES/opsdroid.po`, then compile it, etc.

## Creating New Modules
Opsdroid is an open source chatbot framework. It is designed to be extendable, scalable and simple. It comes with a few official modules that can be found in the [Opsdroid  GitHub account](https://github.com/opsdroid).
 
 If you love a particular platform and wish to use opsdroid with it or if you want opsdroid to interact with something in a certain way you can create your own modules and extend the functionality of opsdroid.
 
 If you don't know where to start, make sure to check the [tutorials](tutorials) and read the [documentation](http://opsdroid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest).  Remember that you can also ask for help in our [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/opsdroid/)


## Issues
You can help us by reporting new issues or by fixing existing issues. 

If you find any part of opsdroid that's acting odd it would be great if you take the time to create a new issue. That will help us keep opsdroid free of any bugs.

We try to tackle issues as fast as possible, but help would be greatly appreciated. To get started, simply follow the [workflow guidelines](#workflow) and developing instructions.
