# Slack connector

A connector for [Slack](https://slack.com/).

## Requirements

 * A Slack account
 * The token from a [custom bot integration](https://my.slack.com/apps/A0F7YS25R-bots)

## Configuration

```yaml
connectors:
  - name: slack
    # required
    api-token: "zyxw-abdcefghi-12345"
    # optional
    bot-name: "mybot" # default "opsdroid"
    default-room: "#random" # default "#general"
    icon-emoji: ":smile:" # default ":robot_face:"
    connect-timeout: 10 # default 10 seconds
```

## Usage
The connector itself won't allow opsdroid to do much. It will connect to Slack and be active on the `default-room`
but you will still need some skill to have opsdroid react to an input.

Luckily, opsdroid comes with a few skills out of the box as well. So once you run opsdroid you will see that it joined either the room that you set up on `default-room` parameter in the configuration or it will be in the `#general` room.

_Note: If opsdroid failed to join the room you can always invite him by clicking `info>Members section>invite more people...`_

You can also interact with opsdroid through direct message. To do so, just click on opsdroid's name and type something on the box that says "Message opsdroid".

Example of a private message:

```
fabiorosado [7:06 PM]
hi

opsdroid APP [7:06 PM]
Hi fabiorosado
```

## Rich layouts and blocks

Slack has support for [rich layouts](https://api.slack.com/messaging/composing/layouts) using a concept they call [blocks](https://api.slack.com/reference/messaging/blocks). Blocks are JSON objects which describe a rich element, and a list of them can be passed instead of a message to produce rich content.

To do this you need to respond with an `opsdroid.connector.slack.events.Blocks` event which is constructed with a list of blocks.

### Example

```python
from opsdroid.skill import Skill
from opsdroid.matchers import match_regex
from opsdroid.connector.slack.events import Blocks


class BlocksSkill(Skill):

    @match_regex(r"who are you\?")
    async def who_are_you(self, event):
        await event.respond(Blocks([
                {
                    "type": "section",
                    "text": {
                        "type": "mrkdwn",
                        "text": "Hey! I'm opsdroid.\nI'm a natural language event driven automation bot framework.\n*What a mouthful!*"
                    },
                    "accessory": {
                        "type": "image",
                        "image_url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opsdroid/style-guidelines/master/logos/logo-light.png",
                        "alt_text": "opsdroid logo"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "type": "actions",
                    "elements": [
                        {
                            "type": "button",
                            "text": {
                                "type": "plain_text",
                                "text": "Visit website",
                                "emoji": True
                            },
                            "url": "https://opsdroid.dev"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        ))

```
