## Config file

For configuration, you simply need to create a single YAML file named `configuration.yaml`. When you run opsdroid it will look for the file in the following places in order:

 * `./configuration.yaml`
 * `~/.opsdroid/configuration.yaml`
 * `/etc/opsdroid/configuration.yaml`

The opsdroid project itself is very simple and requires modules to give it functionality. In your configuration file, you must specify the connector, skill and database* modules you wish to use and any options they may require.

**Connectors** are modules for connecting opsdroid to your specific chat service. **Skills** are modules which define what actions opsdroid should perform based on different chat messages. **Database** modules connect opsdroid to your chosen database and allow skills to store information between messages.

For example, a simple barebones configuration would look like:

```yaml
connectors:
  - name: shell

skills:
  - name: hello
```

This tells opsdroid to use the [shell connector](https://github.com/opsdroid/connector-shell) and [hello skill](https://github.com/opsdroid/skill-hello) from the official module library.

In opsdroid all modules are git repositories which will be cloned locally the first time they are used. By default, if you do not specify a repository opsdroid will look at `https://github.com/opsdroid/<moduletype>-<modulename>.git` for the repository. Therefore in the above configuration, the `connector-shell` and `skill-hello` repositories were pulled from the opsdroid organisation on GitHub.

You are of course encouraged to write your own modules and make them available on GitHub or any other repository host which is accessible by your opsdroid installation.

A more advanced config would like similar to the following:

```yaml
connectors:
  - name: slack
    token: "mysecretslacktoken"

databases:
  - name: mongo
    host: "mymongohost.mycompany.com"
    port: "27017"
    database: "opsdroid"

skills:
  - name: hello
  - name: seen
  - name: myawesomeskill
    repo: "https://github.com/username/myawesomeskill.git"
```

In this configuration we are using the [slack connector](https://github.com/opsdroid/connector-slack) with a slack [auth token](https://api.slack.com/tokens) supplied, a [mongo database](https://github.com/opsdroid/database-mongo) connection for persisting data, `hello` and `seen` skills from the official repos and finally a custom skill hosted on GitHub.

Configuration options such as the `token` in the slack connector or the `host`, `port` and `database` options in the mongo database are specific to those modules. Ensure you check each module's required configuration items before you use them.

## Reference

### Connector Modules

Connector modules which are installed and connect opsdroid to a specific chat service.

_Config options of the connectors themselves differ between connectors, see the connector documentation for details._

```yaml
connectors:

  - name: slack
    token: "mysecretslacktoken"

  # conceptual connector
  - name: twitter
    oauth_key: "myoauthkey"
    secret_key: "myoauthsecret"
```

Some connectors will allow you to specify a delay to simulate a real user, you just need to add the delay option under a connector in the `configuration.yaml` file.

**Thinking Delay:** accepts a _int_, _float_ or a _list_ to delay reply by _x_ seconds.
**Typing Delay:** accepts a _int_ or _float_ that represents the number of characters typed per second. This number should be larger or equal to 6 to avoid lagging. 


Example:

```yaml
connectors:
  - name: slack
    token: "mysecretslacktoken"
    thinking-delay: <int, float or two element list>
    typing-delay: <int or float>
```

_Note: As expected this will cause a delay on opsdroid time of response so make sure you don't pass a high number._ 

See [module options](#module-options) for installing custom connectors.

### Database Modules

Database modules which connect opsdroid to a persistent data storage service.

Skills can store data in opsdroid's "memory", this is a dictionary which can be persisted in an external database.

_Config options of the databases themselves differ between databases, see the database documentation for details._

```yaml
databases:
  - name: mongo
    host: "mymongohost.mycompany.com"
    port: "27017"
    database: "opsdroid"
```

See [module options](#module-options) for installing custom databases.

### Logging

Configure logging in opsdroid.

Setting `path` will configure where opsdroid writes the log file to. This location must be writeable by the user running opsdroid. Setting this to `false` will disable log file output.

All python logging levels are available in opsdroid. `level` can be set to `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error` and `critical`.

You may not want opsdroid to log to the console, for example, if you are using the shell connector. However, if running in a container you may want exactly that. Setting `console` to `true` or `false` will enable or disable console logging.

```yaml
logging:
  path: ~/.opsdroid/output.log
  level: info
  console: true

connectors:
  - name: shell

skills:
  - name: hello
  - name: seen
```

### Installation Path

Set the path for opsdroid to use when installing skills. Defaults to the current working directory.

```yaml
module-path: "/etc/opsdroid/modules"

connectors:
  - name: shell

skills:
  - name: hello
  - name: seen
```

### Skills

Skill modules which add functionality to opsdroid.

_Config options of the skills themselves differ between skills, see the skill documentation for details._

```yaml
skills:
  - name: hello
  - name: seen
```

See [module options](#module-options) for installing custom skills.

### Time Zone

Configure the timezone.

This timezone will be used in crontab skills if the timezone has not been set as a kwarg in the crontab decorator. All [timezone names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) from the [tz database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones) are valid here.

```yaml
timezone: 'Europe/London'
```

### Web Server

Configure the REST API in opsdroid.

By default, opsdroid will start a web server accessible only to localhost on port `8080` (or `8443` if ssl details are provided). For more information see the [REST API docs](rest-api).

```yaml
web:
  host: '127.0.0.1'  # set to '0.0.0.0' to allow all traffic
  port: 8080
  ssl:
    cert: /path/to/cert.pem
    key: /path/to/key.pem
```

## Module options

### Install Location

All modules are installed from git repositories. By default, if no additional options are specified opsdroid will look for the repository at `https://github.com/opsdroid/<moduletype>-<modulename>.git`.

However, if you wish to install a module from a different location you can specify one of the following options.

#### Git Repository

A git URL to install the module from.

```yaml
connectors:
  - name: slack
    token: "mysecretslacktoken"
  - name: mynewconnector
    repo: https://github.com/username/myconnector.git
```

_Note: When using a git repository, Opsdroid will try to update it at startup pulling with fast forward strategy._

#### Local Directory

A local path to install the module from.

```yaml
skills:
  - name: myawesomeskill
    path: /home/me/src/opsdroid-skills/myawesomeskill
```

Or you can specify a single file.

```yaml
skills:
  - name: myawesomeskill
    path: /home/me/src/opsdroid-skills/myawesomeskill/myskill.py
```

### Disable Caching

Set `no-cache` to true to do a fresh git clone of the module whenever you start opsdroid.

```yaml
databases:
  - name: mongodb
    repo: https://github.com/username/mymongofork.git
    no-cache: true
```

## Environment variables

You can use environment variables in your config. You need to specify the variable in the place of a value.

```yaml
skills:
  - name: myawesomeskill
    somekey: $ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE
```

_Note: Your environment variable names must consist of uppercase characters and underscores only. The value must also be just the environment variable, you cannot currently mix env vars inside strings._

## Include additional yaml files

You can split the config into smaller modules by using the value `!include file.yaml` to import the contents of a yaml file into the main config. 


```yaml
skills: !include skills.yaml

```

_Note: The file.yaml that you wish to include in the config must be in the same directory as your configuration.yaml (e.g ~/.opsdroid)_
