class ExternalAPIMockServer:
    """A webserver which can pretend to be an external API.

    The general idea with this class is to allow you to push expected responses onto
    a stack for each API call you expect your test to make. Then as your tests make those
    calls each response is popped from the stack.

    You can then assert that routes were called and that data and headers were sent correctly.

    Your test will need to switch the URL of the API calls, so the thing you are testing should be
    configurable at runtime. You will also need to capture the responses from the real API your are
    mocking and store them as JSON files. Then you can push those responses onto the stack at the start
    of your test.

    Examples:
        A simple example of pushing a response onto a stack and making a request::

                mock_api.add_response("/test", "GET", None, 200)

                # Create a closure function. We will have our mock_api run this concurrently with the
                # web server later.

                            assert resp.status == 200
                            assert mock_api.called("/test")
